# Refactoring Like Compilers

This is a Legacy Code Kata demonstrating Refactoring Like a Compiler

1. Start with the example in `de.andrena.refactoringlikecompilers`
2. Transform it to static single assignment form (in short: ensure that each variable is assigned at mostly once) - `de.andrena.refactoringlikecompilers.ssa`
3. Simplify the code and build an enum from `gender` - `de.andrena.refactoringlikecompilers.toobjects1` 
4. Build an object from `name` - `de.andrena.refactoringlikecompilers.toobjects2` 

This example was exercised at [XP-Days 2018](https://www.xpdays.de/2018/sessions/153-refactoring-lerne-von-modernen-compilern.html). You can find some hints in the attached presentation.
